      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <h4>
        I am Samuel Medina Gonzalez, a systems engineering student at EIA
        University. I enjoy spending time with family and friends, I like
        sports, and I love the ability to create new worlds that programming
        gives me. Although I don't have experience beyond the projects
        completed for university, I understand the responsibility and
        discipline that work entails, thanks to my experience in a family
        business called Parafinados Medellin. I am eager to learn and
        constantly explore, enriching myself with valuable knowledge and
        experiences in various areas of my life.
