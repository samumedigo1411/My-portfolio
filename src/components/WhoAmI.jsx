        I am Samuel Medina Gonzalez, a systems engineering student at EIA University. I enjoy spending time with family and friends, I like sports, and I love the ability to create new worlds that programming gives me. Although I don't have experience beyond the projects completed for university, I understand the responsibility and discipline that work entails, thanks to my experience in a family business called Parafinados Medellin. I am eager to learn and constantly explore, enriching myself with valuable knowledge and experiences in various areas of my life.
